    Fixed concurrency issues.

2018-10-28

    Switched to Maven.

2008-01-22

    Added 'make-environment' and 'environment?' primitives, the former to
    create a new environment and the latter to test if a value is an
    environment.
    The 'help' primitive is now syntax, so now one can do '(help if)' without
    using 'quote'.

2008-01-20

    Changed the way primitive procedures are defined and invoked.
    Reflection is not used any more, thus achieving 30x faster calls.
    Primitives are defined as anonymous classes in arrays of primitives,
    overriding one of the apply methods (a funny way to obtain anonymous
    functions in Java :-))
    Introduced a new syntax: 'in-environment' to evaluate an expression in
    a given environment. This, along with the 'current-environment'
    primitive should complete the treatment of environments as first-order
    values in Gleam.
    Reworked the logging class, now called 'gleam.util.Log', in order to use
    the 'java.util.logging' facility.

Release 0.89
2007-02-04

    Changed the convention for argument passing to primitive procedures
    written in Java. Procedures with 0..3 arguments now have specific
    signatures. Checking of correct number of arguments was factored out of
    library procedures in gleam.library, and moved to PrimitiveProcedure.

2007-01-28

    Added the gleam.lang.JavaObject class, holding arbitrary Java objects.
    The primitives 'new' and 'call' are used to instantiate a Java object
    and to call a method on an instance. 'null' is bound to Java null.
    A first Scheme <-> Java type conversion mechanism is implemented.
    A new 'bind' method in the Interpreter allows Java code to define new
    Scheme variables, holding Java objects, in the session environment.
    Symbols are case-sensitive now, a deviation from R5RS needed to allow
    the usage of symbols for Java class and method names. An effort will be
    made to return to R5RS compliance.
    Added a new 'gleam.util.Report.printStackTrace()' method for debugging.

Release 0.88
2007-01-15

    Added the gleam.lang.Interpreter class, encapsulating the evaluation of
    Scheme expressions. It is possible to have multiple independent
    instances of the Gleam interpreter.
    A severe issue was fixed, where two continuations repeatedly calling
    each other could cause a Java stack overflow. The design flaw was to
    implement the execution of a continuation in the Continuation class
    itself. This is now delegated to the Interpreter.
    Fixed 'save-session' and 'load-session': some environment reachable
    classes (notably Actions) were not marked as Serializable.

Release 0.87
2007-01-05

    The second argument to 'eval' is now optional: if no environment is
    specified, the current environment is used, i.e. the environment in
    effect at the time of the call.
    Improved and corrected 'gleam_eval' implementation, so to perform syntax
    analysis on its argument, and to extend the current continuation with
    its evaluation in the required environment.
    Implemented 'set-car!' and 'set-cdr!'.
    Reworked 'write' so to show quotes and quasiquotes in their short form.
    'car' and 'cdr' now throw exception on the empty list.
    Implemented 'Entity.toString()' to give the same output as 'display'.
    Added 'extend' method to Continuation, and 'append' method to Action, so
    to make Java code simpler when linking new Actions to a Continuation.
    Corrected problems in 'apply' and implemented CL-style 'list*'.
    New 'define-macro' (to test).

Release 0.86
2006-12-20

    Bootstrap implements quasiquotation, 'defmacro', 'cond', 'apply', etc.
    C-style comments are no longer allowed.
    Added EvalAction as support for macro expansion.
    'Pair.eval()' now handles syntax-rewriters correctly.
    SyntaxRewriter merged with SyntaxClosure.
